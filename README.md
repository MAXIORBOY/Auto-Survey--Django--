# Auto-Survey is my first Django project. It's a framework which allows to create custom surveys.
Survey customizable options:
* name  
* description
* photo representing the survey (link)
* orientation of that photo
* end date of voting
* type of vote:
  * single-choice
  * multi-choice (up to n choices)
  * answer comparasion (beetween n random picked choices)
